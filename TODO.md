### TODO:

✔️ Start working with branches, create new branch for each feature

✔️ Make the home page, and add link to the login page

✔️ Add some new fields in the users and re-create the users. See if you broke something

✔️ Try to add timestampable fields, createdAt and updatedAt

<p>Make the registration page</p>
Problems: 
I should not add roles by hand. Check how I have done in Symfony 6

✔️Make the user registration with email validation

<p>Add forgot password feature</p>
<p>Add login with Google, GitHub and LinkedIn feature</p>
